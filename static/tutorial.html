      <h1>Tutorial</h1>
      <ol>
        <h2><li> Create a Google Form</li></h2>
        <p>In this example, I went to the Google forms
        <a href='http://www.google.com/forms/about/'>site</a>. You should be
        able to construct the form using the help provided on the site. Once
        your form is created be sure to save the results to a Google
        spreadsheet rather than leaving the result only in forms.<br/>
        </p>

          <img class='center-block' src='img/screenshot1.png' width='800px' />
          
        <h2><li>Fill data into the Form</li></h2>
        <p>In my case, this was filling out my 
        <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AZvq7lhWikb3uuywXLLtDr32yisZf_wnjSrCRwanXns/viewform?usp=send_form'>form</a>
        for each of my favorite 3 letter animal names that also might happen to
        be ISO codes for languages.
        </p>

        <h2><li>View your results in Google spreadsheets</li></h2>
        <p> After entering all my data it was available
        <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gmMh5SPglbH9oveADHM3CyWcWaJM--ZuS6svjU68LDI/edit?usp=sharing'>here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2><li>Share your results with the Lang Map service account.</li></h2>
        Click the Share button on the spreadsheet of form results:<br/>

        <img class='center-block' src='img/screenshot2.png' width='800px' />

        <p>And give view permissions to the service account used by this website:</p>

        <img class='center-block' src='img/screenshot3.png' width='800px' />

        <p> The account to share it with is: 489541795175-qu1ub95lv6fj41hiim01f1bdccqo17c8@developer.gserviceaccount.com </p>

        <h2><li>Find your worksheet on the main page</li></h2>
        Navigate to the <a href='/'>homepage</a> and you should be able to see
        your worksheet now. Click the link and wait a few seconds while it
        retrieves data from google sheets.
        <img class='center-block' src='img/screenshot4.png' width='800px' />

        <h2><li>View your first data row in JSON form</li></h2>

        <p>First of all, pardon me if this interface seems sort of clunky. I
        hope you find this tool useful, but I'm not a front-end or usability
        expert by any means.</p>

        <p>Once the data have been loaded, you should be able to see the first row
        of your spreadsheet in JSON form. If you're lucky the site will also
        have automatically determined that one of the columns of your data was
        the ISO of the language. If that happened, you should also see some
        additional language data downloaded from glottolog.org in that box.</p>

        <img class='center-block' src='img/screenshot5.png' width='800px' />

        <h2><li>Python Round 1: A New Interface</li></h2>

        <p>The next thing on the page is an empty box labelled "Output" and
        finally a dark box for Python code. This box can be used to write
        python that can be used to process and map the data in your
        spreadsheet.</p>

        <p>The function named "process" is special. It will be called once for
        each row in your Google Spreadsheet. This function will take two
        arguments, 'record' (a dict from your spreadsheet) and 'glotto' (a dict
        for the corresponding language on glottolog.org).</p>

        <p>To help you visualize what these dicts contain you can look at the
        Input box.</p>

        <p> For starters, let's write a really simple processing function that
        just returns the row from our data and press "Run On Single Input".</p>

<pre>
def process(record, glotto):
    return record
</pre>
 
        <p>We see after pressing Run on Single Input that the output is simply
        the "record" portion of the input as expected.</p>

        <img class='center-block' src='img/screenshot6.png' width='800px' />

        <p> Since that looks good (although the keys are a bit long). Let's
        press "Map All". At this point scroll down to the bottom of the page.
        You'll notice the Map was empty, we'll get to that later, but at the
        bottom of the page there is a full table, with one entry for each of
        the processed values. </p>

        <img class='center-block' src='img/screenshot7.png' width='800px' />

        <h2><li>Python Round 2: Cleaning the Data</li></h2>

        <p>
        Before we get into some of the fancier features of the site. I'd like
        to start by making the data look a bit cleaner. Specifically, right now
        the keys of the records are long and sloppy, and I'd like to convert
        the long keys to shorter ones that are easier to type and remember.
        </p>

        <p>
        In addition, I'd like to create some derivative data. Lets try to turn
        the uses of each animal into a proper python list, and record the
        number of uses in a different column.
        </p>

<h3> New Code</h3>

<pre>
remapping = {
      "letteranimalthatisalsoalanguageisocode": "iso",
      "sizeoftheanimal": "size",
      "whywouldsomeoneraiseorowntheanimal": "uses"
  }

def remap(record):
    result = {}
    for k in record:
        if k in remapping:
            result[remapping[k]] = record[k]
    return result

def process(record, glotto):
    result = remap(record)
    result['uses'] = [] if not result['uses'] else result['uses'].split(',')
    result['num_uses'] = len(result['uses'])
</pre>

<h3> New Output</h3>
<pre>
{
    "iso": "bee",
    "size": "Small",
    "uses": [
        "Produced non-meat food"
    ],
    "num_uses": 1
}
</pre>
        
        <p>That looks much better</p>

        <h2><li>Python Round 3: Maps</li></h2>
<p> Now that we've got a nice clean source of data, it's time to try to put
things to the map. While we're at it, we should also probably get the language
name for the codes we've invented. To do this, we can simply grab the 'name',
'longitude', and 'latitude' fields from the glotto dict.</p>

<p> Note that these three fields are special on the LangMap website. If you
return a python dictionary with both a 'longitude' and a 'latitude' key it will
draw a dot on the world map at that location. If the dictionary that you return
has a key named 'name' then that will be the mouseover text when you hover over
that dot on the map.</p>

<h3> New Code</h3>
<pre>
remapping = {
      "letteranimalthatisalsoalanguageisocode": "iso",
      "sizeoftheanimal": "size",
      "whywouldsomeoneraiseorowntheanimal": "uses"
  }

def remap(record):
    result = {}
    for k in record:
        if k in remapping:
            result[remapping[k]] = record[k]
    return result

def process(record, glotto):
    result = remap(record)
    result['uses'] = [] if not result['uses'] else result['uses'].split(',')
    result['num_uses'] = len(result['uses'])
    result['longitude'] = glotto.get('longitude')
    result['latitude'] = glotto.get('latitude')
    result['name'] = glotto.get('name')
    return result
</pre>

<p>Then pressing Map All...</p>

<h3> New Map</h3>
        <img class='center-block' src='img/screenshot8.png' width='800px' />

<p>TaDa! We have a graph. Unfortunately there are some suspicious dots in the
middle of the ocean. Scrolling down to the Table we can see that 'pig' and
'owl' do not actually correspond to the ISO code for any real languages. 
Instead it seems we just got markers placed at (0,0) for those languages. In
the next section we'll look at removing them.</p>

        <h2><li>Python Round 4: Filtering</li></h2>

<p>You don't have to return a valid dict for every language you are passed.
Instead, if a given language is uninteresting you can just return "None". In
our case, we want to return "None" if there is no glotto data for that entry as
that will prevent us from being able map them. For real data it might be more
interesting to filter the data based on region or features while diving into
specific phenomena.</p>

<pre>
remapping = {
      "letteranimalthatisalsoalanguageisocode": "iso",
      "sizeoftheanimal": "size",
      "whywouldsomeoneraiseorowntheanimal": "uses"
  }

def remap(record):
    result = {}
    for k in record:
        if k in remapping:
            result[remapping[k]] = record[k]
    return result

def process(record, glotto):
    if not glotto:
        return None
    result = remap(record)
    result['uses'] = [] if not result['uses'] else result['uses'].split(',')
    result['num_uses'] = len(result['uses'])
    result['longitude'] = glotto.get('longitude')
    result['latitude'] = glotto.get('latitude')
    result['name'] = glotto.get('name')
    return result
</pre>

<p> Pressing "Map All" and investigating the Map and the Table shows this has
had the desired effect.</p>

        <h2><li>Python Round 5: Colors</li></h2>
<p>Just like for 'longitude', 'latitude', and 'name' there is also a special
key 'color' that can be used to set the color of the dot on the world map. To
specify a color, you must specify the color in terms of quantities of red,
green, and blue. These values must be expressed from 0 to 255 in a list.</p>

<p>For example <code> [255, 0, 0] </code> is bright red,
<code> [255, 0, 255]</code> is bright purple, and <code> [0, 0, 0] </code> is
black.  Searching the internet for RGB and Color Pickers will give you a bit of
context as to why colors are done this way, as well as give you nice tools to
learn the RGB values of any colors you wish to use.</p>

<p>Using this information we can set the color of each dot based on the size of
the animal corresponding to it's ISO code using the following code:</p>

<h3>Final Code</h3>

<pre>
remapping = {
      "letteranimalthatisalsoalanguageisocode": "iso",
      "sizeoftheanimal": "size",
      "whywouldsomeoneraiseorowntheanimal": "uses"
  }
  
red = [170, 0, 0]
green = [0, 170, 0]
blue = [0, 0, 170]

def setColor(result):
    size = result['size']
    if size == 'Small':
        result['color'] = red
    elif size == 'Medium':
        result['color'] = green
    else:
        result['color'] = blue

def remap(record):
    result = {}
    for k in record:
        if k in remapping:
            result[remapping[k]] = record[k]
    return result

def process(record, glotto):
    if not glotto:
        return None
    result = remap(record)
    result['uses'] = [] if not result['uses'] else result['uses'].split(',')
    result['num_uses'] = len(result['uses'])
    result['longitude'] = glotto.get('longitude')
    result['latitude'] = glotto.get('latitude')
    result['name'] = glotto.get('name')
    setColor(result)
    return result
</pre>

<h3>Final Map</h3>
<p> In this map I've colored all the Large animals blue, the Medium animals
Green, and the Small animals red. </p>

        <img class='center-block' src='img/screenshot9.png' width='800px' />

<p> From this it can clearly be seen that the further West a language is spoken
the larger the animal that corresponds to it's ISO code is. I don't think this
result should come as a surprise to anyone.</p>

<p> Hopefully this tutorial/guide has been helpful, and if you have any
additional questions please feel free to reach out to me at sarum90@gmail.com. </p>
